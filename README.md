# Grammatical gender for loanwords in Swedish and Spanish

For this project, I helped a friend with visualizing some data for his bachelor's thesis in linguistics. The thesis examines how grammatical genders are assigned to English and Japanese loanwords in Swedish and Spanish. The images below visualize how native speakers assign a common/neutral (Swedish) or feminine/masculine (Spanish) gender to the loanwords. The respondents are sorted by how often they assign a certain gender on the x axis and the words are sorted by how often they are assigned a certain gender on the y axis.
